# Pro Miner Guide

Mining might look easy, but to not die and bring up a significant profit is not that easy.

### What you need:
* A mining ship (Prospector, Kestrel etc..)
* Salvage gear (mining drill, space suit, protokinetic gun)
* Ore bag
* Meds (Anti-Toxin Medkit and Normal Medkit)
* Food and drinks

### Starting off


First thing you should do is to increase job intake in your station records console by one (or preferably more). This is so you can spawn  back if you die.
You will die if this is your first time mining.

Pilot your ship to a large sized asteroid (one that is bigger than your ship, preferably). Smaller asteroids contain significantly less profit. Once you are at the asteroid, turn oxygen on, take your mining drill and protokinetic, and start hitting the rocks with the mining drill.

### Mining


Mining is simple, just hit the rocks with your drill. Your ore bag collects all ores and artifacts automatically. Once it is full of ores, head back to your ship, and put the ores in the ore processor. Then head back to mine.

Warning! Bigger asteroids have much higher chance of containing lethal enemies. Keep your protokinetic on other hand and be prepared. Fleeing them is not always possible because some of the mobs are faster than you.

While it may be tempting, don't pick up the big artifacts. They are not usually worth much, and even if you encounter the more valuable 1k worth ones, it is usually time wasted from mining ores if you start to dragging big artifacts in.

Once you have mined the whole asteroid, move on to next one. Mine at least 3 large asteroids, before processing and selling. Do not be too greedy! If you die or pirates rob you, you might lose everything if you have not prepared.

### Selling and finishing off


Process some steel and make steel rods.
Take uranium, and make it in to reinforced uranium glass (you need the rods for it)
Then process reinforced plasma glass
Then others
No bananium! It is radioactive.

Sell all at depot
