# Smuggling

Smuggling is an illegal trade in the game, that can be used to make a lot of spesos. In smuggling you smuggle contraband crates from syndicate caches to cargo depots, and try to not get caught by security.

To start a smuggling gig, you will need to find a note with co-ordinates to the syndicate cache containing the contraband crates.

Recommended: Get an IFF board, and build an IFF computer to hide your ship from the map. This will make it harder for security to find you.

### Starting off


To start, head over to one of these locations:

* Robuster's Rest
* Crazy Casey's Casino
* The Pit
* Grifty's Gas And Grub
* The Court Room

Each of these locations have a chance to spawn notes behind posters. Once you are in the location, right click every poster, until you see an option "look closer" or similar. Click that and you will get a note.

Warning: This note is highly illegal and will get you arrested if you are found with it! It is good idea to hide it.

Next, open the note and look at the co-ordinates. Head over to the co-ordinates that you received from the note.

### Picking up the goods


When you arrive at the cache, dock your ship carefully. Be aware, there might be mines in the cache, that will destroy your loot if activated. Try to avoid them.

Smuggle the crates one by one to your ship. Disabling gravity might help in transporting the crates faster.

### Selling the goods


Once you are done, you can fly to the cargo depot to sell your crates. Alternatively, if you picked up multiple notes, you can first pick up the contraband from all of the caches before selling.

Be sure to not be seen at the cargo depot selling the crates if possible, as you can be arrested on sight if you are seen with them.
